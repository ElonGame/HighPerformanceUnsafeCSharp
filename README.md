# High Performance Unsafe C#

Houses code that tries to find the fastest way to accomplish a task (think
microptimizations).  This often includes various unsafe methods.  The idea is that if I come across another method to accomplish a task, I can just add it to the list and see how it performs compared to others.  Also, if I forget the exact details, this will be a convienent reference.
