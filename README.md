# High Performance Unsafe C#

First off, the title of the repo may be a repo.  High performance code and
unsafe C# code aren't a correlation (that I've found and demonstate in some
instances).  Anyways, this repo houses code that tries to find the fastest way
to accomplish a task (think microptimizations).  This often includes various
unsafe methods.  The idea is that if I come across another method to accomplish
a task, I can just add it to the list and see how it performs compared to
others.  Also, if I forget the exact details, this will be a convienent
reference.
